# Biotech Network Analysis (2020–2025)

This repository analyzes yearly correlation-based networks of biotech and healthcare stocks (2020–2025 + FULL).  
For each year we build the network, compute centrality metrics, extract top-5 nodes, and visualize how network structure evolves over time.

The repo includes:
- yearly results (UMAP, clustering, TE graphs, centrality plots),
- aggregated temporal visualizations,
- top-5 metric tracking across years (rank evolution, heatmaps, similarity, frequency).

All plots and CSV files are automatically generated and stored inside each year folder and in the `temporal/` and `top5_results/` directories.
